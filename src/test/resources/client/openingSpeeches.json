BURGE","text":"Is it in a proper place?"},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-SerenaMultilingualNeural","expression":{"style":"serious"}},"speakerName":"THE COURT CLERK","text":"I can turn you up."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"Thank you."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"Ladies and gentlemen, as His Lordship told you yesterday, my name is Bill Burge. This is Chris Browne. We have been assigned to prosecute this matter. My friends, Scott Spencer and Dustin Gillander [sic], are representing Mr. Stanley."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"And, ladies and gentlemen, we do thank you for being here today. You have an important duty to undertake, and -- and, of course, today presented some trying conditions, I’m sure, for many of you, and -- and we thank you very much and -- and we all appreciate that you’re here to do what you -- what is a very important civic duty."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is my opening statement, and the purpose of this statement is so that I can outline to you the evidence that the Crown will be presenting for you so that you can make your proper determination at the end of the case. We will be calling a variety of kinds of evidence. First of all, we’re going to start with three police officers who will describe attending to the scene, what they saw. They will describe the physical setup at the Stanley residence where this incident occurred. They -- you will hear about an examination, a very fine, detailed examination, of -- of that property. Colten Boushie was in a vehicle when he -- when he was shot. You will hear that he died of a gunshot wound. There was a careful examination of the vehicle in -- at the residence or at the location, plus at the police service bay where they went through this vehicle in very great detail. You will also be hearing from a bloodstain pattern analyst who will give you her opinion of what she can determine from the scene, and she’ll tell you what she can’t determine from the scene."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"We will then be calling -- those are the witnesses that I expect to be calling today. Hopefully we’ll get through them all today. Tomorrow we will be calling some civilian evidence. And just so you know, we have sent subpoenas -- we have served subpoenas on everyone who can be compelled to come to court with a subpoena who was there and who has something to say about what happened."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"And just -- just so you know, there may well be some serious contradictions between what people saw. You will be in a very good position to determine what you feel the facts are, what has been proved to you. His Lordship gave you some preliminary instructions yesterday, and at the end of the trial, he will, I am sure, give you further instructions as to how to deal with -- with evidence and how you may come to a unanimous conclusion."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"Ladies and gentlemen, you will hear that Gerald Stanley resided in the Biggar area. He had a farm there where he raised cattle. He also did, as I understand, mechanical work for people in the area. He would fix vehicles. They would bring them to him, leave them in his yard, and he would work on those vehicles."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"The first witness from the civilian side that you will hear from is Sheldon Stanley, and he is Gerald Stanley’s son. He will tell you that he was at his parents’ home -- he doesn’t live there anymore, but he was at his parents’ home on the 9th of August of 2016, that he and his father were working on a fence. They were building a gate for a fence when they heard a rather loud vehicle come into their yard, and that he saw this vehicle stop by a truck that had been left to be repaired. And someone got out of the vehicle and went into the truck, which he just assumed was maybe the owner dropping off a part because that’s -- that seemed to be a typical thing that happened when -- when Mr. Stanley repaired people’s vehicles."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"But then this vehicle went further into the -- into the yard, towards the shop, and someone got out and started -- tried to start a quad that was in the Stanleys’ yard. I believe it was the Stanley -- belonged to the Stanleys. This caused a reaction. Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he ran towards where the quad was. His father came with him. There were several people in this car that had entered the yard. They were -- he was yelling at them, that the -- the people who were out of the -- out of this vehicle got back in. The vehicle backed up. Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he -- as he was building a fence, he had a tool belt on, and he had his hammer with him. He struck the windshield of this car with a hammer."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"The car then headed towards the driveway that would lead to the grid road. As the car was going in that direction, it collided with another vehicle in their yard. Sheldon Stanley says he was running to his house to get his car keys, thinking he would be following this vehicle. As he was running into the house, he heard two gunshots."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"When he came out of the house with his -- with his car keys, he heard another gunshot. He looked. He saw his father standing by the driver’s door of this vehicle with a gun and a clip in his hand. That when Sheldon Stanley approached the vehicle, he saw Colten Boushie in the driver’s seat, slumped towards the right with the steering wheel of the vehicle. There were two females in the back seat. Two other males in the vehicle had got out and ran away after the vehicle collided with the other vehicle."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"Ladies and gentlemen, this case, it might be a shorter case than a lot of murder trials. It’s partly because there’s -- it’s based on eyewitnesses. In addition to that, ladies and gentlemen, my friend has been very -- my friend, Mr. Spencer, has been very professional in his handling of this matter. He has agreed to admit many facts that would be easy for the Crown to prove, but it would take -- it takes time. It becomes cumbersome. And so we have been able to just get down to what is important in this case."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"And by agreeing to certain facts, we have been able to eliminate a lot of witnesses. That includes -- we will be filing reports of experts. There is a report from Mr. -- Dr. Claude Dalpe. He’s a trace evidence expert, and his report will indicate that -- Gerald Stanley was arrested after this incident, ladies and gentlemen. He was examined by the police for what -- they use what’s called a gunshot residue kit where they check his hands and his face to see if he was in proximity to a firearm. And -- and there were positive results, which means that either Mr. Stanley fired a firearm, he was in close proximity to a firearm when it was fired, or he handled a firearm that had been fired. And that will be in a report from Dr. Dalpe that will be filed as evidence by consent."},{"speaker":{"voiceId":"en-US-AdamMultilingualNeural"},"speakerName":"MR. BURGE","text":"We have reports from Gillian Sayers. She’s a specialist at the -- with the RCMP forensic lab. So was Dr. Dalpe with the forensic lab of the RCMP. Gillian Sayers reports -- she -- she’s a DNA specialist, and she has examined certain items, including swabs of blood from the driver’s seat of this vehicle and from the floor of the driver’s compartment of the vehicle, and she’s determined to her satisfaction that this is the blood of Colten Boushie. You’ll see her -- her reports will be in evidence, and -- and the number she uses is that -- she says it’s his blood, and the chance of this being someone else’s blood is one in a quintillion, which is -- wasn’t a number that I’m familiar with, but it’s a one followed by 18 zeros. So she’s fairly confident as to whose blood this was."}]
