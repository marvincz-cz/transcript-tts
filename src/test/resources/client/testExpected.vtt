00:00.050 --> 00:00.400
<v SERGEANT BARNES>If I may,

00:00.400 --> 00:03.250
<v SERGEANT BARNES>I’d like to refer to my notes from time to time just to keep things in --

00:03.250 --> 00:04.300
<v SERGEANT BARNES>in line and perspective?

00:04.300 --> 00:06.300
<v SERGEANT BARNES>I’ve also prepared a PowerPoint presentation,

00:06.300 --> 00:07.450
<v SERGEANT BARNES>along with these booklets,

00:07.450 --> 00:09.600
<v SERGEANT BARNES>that are the same photographs as in the PowerPoint.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.000
<v SERGEANT BARNES>And I’d like to use these to illustrate the scene and what I documented on that day.
