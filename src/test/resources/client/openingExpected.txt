17.390774514s|19.318909341s|We have been assigned to prosecute this matter.
20.157773195s|22.824609027s|My friends, Scott Spencer and Dustin Gillander [sic],

43.846286787s|46.688407604s|Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is my opening statement,
46.901253657s|47.026457217s|and the
47.101579353s|49.981261238s|purpose of this statement is so that I can outline to you the evidence that the
50.056383374s|52.009558913s|Crown will be presenting for you so that you can make your
52.084681050s|54.050376945s|proper determination at the end of the case.
54.901761154s|57.268108442s|We will be calling a variety of kinds of evidence.
58.119492652s|1m 0.097708903s|First of all, we’re going to start with three
1m 0.160310683s|1m 2.626820819s|police officers who will describe attending to the scene,
1m 2.651861532s|1m 3.315440401s|what they saw.
1m 4.154304254s|1m 5.719348757s|They will describe the physical setup at
1m 5.769430181s|1m 7.947972129s|the Stanley residence where this incident occurred.
1m 8.786835982s|1m 9.174967019s|They --
1m 9.312690935s|1m 13.557091626s|you will hear about an examination, a very fine, detailed examination, of --
1m 13.707335899s|1m 14.496118328s|of that property.
1m 15.347502537s|1m 18.214664066s|Colten Boushie was in a vehicle when he -- when he was shot.
1m 19.053527920s|1m 21.169468087s|You will hear that he died of a gunshot wound.
1m 22.020852297s|1m 24.299557093s|There was a careful examination of the vehicle in --
1m 24.412240297s|1m 26.528180465s|at the residence or at the location, plus at the
1m 26.603302601s|1m 29.094853449s|police service bay where they went through this vehicle in very
1m 29.169975585s|1m 29.971278371s|great detail.
1m 30.822662580s|1m 32.087218538s|You will also be hearing from a
1m 32.137299962s|1m 33.614701973s|bloodstain pattern analyst who will
1m 33.664783397s|1m 34.754054371s|give you her opinion of what she
1m 34.804135795s|1m 36.031130685s|can determine from the scene,
1m 36.256497093s|1m 38.497640821s|and she’ll tell you what she can’t determine from the scene.
1m 39.349025031s|1m 42.804643293s|We will then be calling -- those are the witnesses that I expect to be calling today.
1m 43.656027502s|1m 45.471479125s|Hopefully we’ll get through them all today.
1m 46.322863335s|1m 48.726771691s|Tomorrow we will be calling some civilian evidence.
1m 49.578155900s|1m 51.744177492s|And just so you know, we have sent subpoenas --
1m 51.831819984s|1m 54.523696529s|we have served subpoenas on everyone who can be compelled to come to
1m 54.598818665s|1m 57.854111231s|court with a subpoena who was there and who has something to say about what happened.
1m 58.692975084s|2m 0.320621367s|And just -- just so you know,
2m 0.420784215s|2m 3.463230728s|there may well be some serious contradictions between what people saw.
2m 4.314614938s|2m 7.544866791s|You will be in a very good position to determine what you feel the facts are,
2m 7.607468571s|2m 8.759341325s|what has been proved to you.
2m 9.610725535s|2m 12.653172048s|His Lordship gave you some preliminary instructions yesterday,
2m 12.853497744s|2m 15.595455713s|and at the end of the trial, he will, I am sure,
2m 15.783261053s|2m 18.061965849s|give you further instructions as to how to deal with --
2m 18.187169409s|2m 20.841484886s|with evidence and how you may come to a unanimous conclusion.
2m 21.692869096s|2m 25.624260886s|Ladies and gentlemen, you will hear that Gerald Stanley resided in the Biggar area.
2m 26.475645096s|2m 28.353698499s|He had a farm there where he raised cattle.
2m 29.205082708s|2m 30.094027986s|He also did,
2m 30.269312970s|2m 33.249157703s|as I understand, mechanical work for people in the area.
2m 34.113062269s|2m 35.302496091s|He would fix vehicles.
2m 36.141359944s|2m 38.407544384s|They would bring them to him, leave them in his yard,
2m 38.582829369s|2m 40.122833159s|and he would work on those vehicles.
2m 40.961697013s|2m 44.479917055s|The first witness from the civilian side that you will hear from is Sheldon Stanley,
2m 44.667722395s|2m 46.270327966s|and he is Gerald Stanley’s son.
2m 47.121712175s|2m 50.527249013s|He will tell you that he was at his parents’ home -- he doesn’t live there anymore,
2m 50.702533997s|2m 54.158152259s|but he was at his parents’ home on the 9th of August of 2016,
2m 54.245794751s|2m 56.148888867s|that he and his father were working on a fence.
2m 57.000273076s|2m 57.651331589s|They were building a
2m 57.713933369s|2m 59.817353181s|gate for a fence when they heard a rather loud vehicle
2m 59.879954961s|3m 0.831502019s|come into their yard,
3m 1.056868427s|3m 4.312160993s|and that he saw this vehicle stop by a truck that had been left to be repaired.
3m 5.151024846s|3m 7.680136762s|And someone got out of the vehicle and went into the truck,
3m 7.830381035s|3m 11.123234668s|which he just assumed was maybe the owner dropping off a part because that’s --
3m 11.260958585s|3m 13.389419108s|that seemed to be a typical thing that happened when --
3m 13.452020888s|3m 15.605522124s|when Mr. Stanley repaired people’s vehicles.
3m 16.444385978s|3m 20.112850292s|But then this vehicle went further into the -- into the yard, towards the shop,
3m 20.313175988s|3m 21.790577999s|and someone got out and started --
3m 21.890740847s|3m 24.131884575s|tried to start a quad that was in the Stanleys’ yard.
3m 24.970748428s|3m 27.700186041s|I believe it was the Stanley -- belonged to the Stanleys.
3m 28.539049894s|3m 29.753524428s|This caused a reaction.
3m 30.604908638s|3m 33.885241916s|Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he ran towards where the quad was.
3m 34.724105769s|3m 35.901019235s|His father came with him.
3m 36.752403445s|3m 39.294035717s|There were several people in this car that had entered the yard.
3m 40.132899570s|3m 40.696315591s|They were --
3m 40.808998795s|3m 43.363151424s|he was yelling at them, that the -- the people who were out of the --
3m 43.475834628s|3m 44.953236639s|out of this vehicle got back in.
3m 45.804620848s|3m 46.831290042s|The vehicle backed up.
3m 47.682674251s|3m 49.485605518s|Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he --
3m 49.648370147s|3m 53.604802649s|as he was building a fence, he had a tool belt on, and he had his hammer with him.
3m 54.468707215s|3m 56.684810231s|He struck the windshield of this car with a hammer.
3m 57.536194440s|4m 0.716364870s|The car then headed towards the driveway that would lead to the grid road.
4m 1.555228723s|4m 3.295558210s|As the car was going in that direction,
4m 3.333119278s|4m 5.336376242s|it collided with another vehicle in their yard.
4m 6.175240095s|4m 9.518175153s|Sheldon Stanley says he was running to his house to get his car keys,
4m 9.618338001s|4m 11.396228556s|thinking he would be following this vehicle.
4m 12.247612766s|4m 15.114774294s|As he was running into the house, he heard two gunshots.
4m 15.953638148s|4m 18.695596116s|When he came out of the house with his -- with his car keys,
4m 18.795758965s|4m 20.022753855s|he heard another gunshot.
4m 20.861617708s|4m 21.425033729s|He looked.
4m 22.276417939s|4m 25.206181248s|He saw his father standing by the driver’s door of this vehicle with a
4m 25.293823740s|4m 26.633501834s|gun and a clip in his hand.
4m 27.472365688s|4m 29.625866923s|That when Sheldon Stanley approached the vehicle,
4m 29.776111196s|4m 31.816929227s|he saw Colten Boushie in the driver’s seat,
4m 31.917092075s|4m 34.446203992s|slumped towards the right with the steering wheel of the vehicle.
4m 35.297588201s|4m 37.213202672s|There were two females in the back seat.
4m 38.052066526s|4m 39.567029604s|Two other males in the vehicle had
4m 39.642151741s|4m 42.884923950s|got out and ran away after the vehicle collided with the other vehicle.
4m 43.736308160s|4m 45.476637647s|Ladies and gentlemen, this case,
4m 45.589320851s|4m 48.181034547s|it might be a shorter case than a lot of murder trials.
4m 49.019898401s|4m 51.774376725s|It’s partly because there’s -- it’s based on eyewitnesses.
4m 52.613240579s|4m 56.744958066s|In addition to that, ladies and gentlemen, my friend has been very -- my friend,
4m 56.820080202s|4m 57.646423699s|Mr. Spencer,
4m 57.884310464s|5m 0.288218820s|has been very professional in his handling of this matter.
5m 1.127082674s|5m 4.695384139s|He has agreed to admit many facts that would be easy for the Crown to prove,
5m 4.732945208s|5m 6.398152559s|but it would take -- it takes time.
5m 7.249536768s|5m 8.326287386s|It becomes cumbersome.
5m 9.177671595s|5m 12.458004873s|And so we have been able to just get down to what is important in this case.
5m 13.296868726s|5m 17.290862297s|And by agreeing to certain facts, we have been able to eliminate a lot of witnesses.
5m 18.129726151s|5m 20.896724831s|That includes -- we will be filing reports of experts.
5m 21.735588685s|5m 23.025185355s|There is a report from Mr. --
5m 23.876569565s|5m 24.953320182s|Dr. Claude Dalpe.
5m 25.792184036s|5m 27.269586046s|He’s a trace evidence expert,
5m 27.419830319s|5m 28.947313753s|and his report will indicate that --
5m 29.786177607s|5m 33.504723345s|Gerald Stanley was arrested after this incident, ladies and gentlemen.
5m 34.356107555s|5m 36.221640602s|He was examined by the police for what --
5m 36.434486654s|5m 38.587987890s|they use what’s called a gunshot residue kit where they
5m 38.663110026s|5m 40.691407701s|check his hands and his face to see if he was in
5m 40.766529838s|5m 42.106207932s|proximity to a firearm.
5m 42.970112497s|5m 44.873206613s|And -- and there were positive results,
5m 45.035971241s|5m 47.652725649s|which means that either Mr. Stanley fired a firearm,
5m 47.853051346s|5m 50.670131451s|he was in close proximity to a firearm when it was fired,
5m 50.832896079s|5m 52.811112330s|or he handled a firearm that had been fired.
5m 53.649976184s|5m 55.240061399s|And that will be in a report from Dr.
5m 55.302663179s|5m 57.531286550s|Dalpe that will be filed as evidence by consent.
5m 58.370150404s|6m 0.298285231s|We have reports from Gillian Sayers.
6m 1.137149085s|6m 4.167075242s|She’s a specialist at the -- with the RCMP forensic lab.
6m 5.005939095s|6m 8.048385608s|So was Dr. Dalpe with the forensic lab of the RCMP.
6m 8.899769818s|6m 10.690180729s|Gillian Sayers reports -- she --
6m 10.777823221s|6m 12.180103096s|she’s a DNA specialist,
6m 12.405469504s|6m 14.058156499s|and she has examined certain items,
6m 14.258482195s|6m 15.698323138s|including swabs of blood from the
6m 15.760924918s|6m 17.826783661s|driver’s seat of this vehicle and from the floor of the
6m 17.889385441s|6m 19.429389232s|driver’s compartment of the vehicle,
6m 19.654755640s|6m 22.935088918s|and she’s determined to her satisfaction that this is the blood of Colten Boushie.
6m 23.786473128s|6m 24.537694489s|You’ll see her --
6m 24.725499829s|6m 26.127779703s|her reports will be in evidence,
6m 26.315585044s|6m 28.293801295s|and -- and the number she uses is that --
6m 28.431525212s|6m 29.495755473s|she says it’s his blood,
6m 29.708601526s|6m 32.776088751s|and the chance of this being someone else’s blood is one in a quintillion,
6m 32.801129463s|6m 33.301943704s|which is --
6m 33.389586196s|6m 35.067313903s|wasn’t a number that I’m familiar with,
6m 35.192517463s|6m 37.396100123s|but it’s a one followed by 18 zeros.
6m 38.247484332s|6m 40.851718385s|So she’s fairly confident as to whose blood this was.
