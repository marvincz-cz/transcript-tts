1.812500s|4.412500s|Mr. Burge, you may need to move the microphone.
4.662500s|6.362500s|Is it in a proper place?
6.612500s|7.687500s|I can turn you up.
7.937500s|8.85s|Thank you.
9.1s|10.775s|Ladies and gentlemen,
10.775s|13.05s|as His Lordship told you yesterday,
13.05s|14.687500s|my name is Bill Burge.
14.937500s|16.362500s|This is Chris Browne.
16.612500s|19.45s|We have been assigned to prosecute this matter.
19.7s|20.787500s|My friends,
20.787500s|23.212500s|Scott Spencer and Dustin Gillander [sic],
23.212500s|25.05s|are representing Mr. Stanley.
25.3s|27.712500s|And, ladies and gentlemen,
27.712500s|29.737500s|we do thank you for being here today.
29.987500s|32.225s|You have an important duty to undertake,
32.237500s|34.425s|and -- and, of course,
34.425s|36.625s|today presented some trying conditions,
36.625s|39.362500s|I’m sure, for many of you, and --
39.362500s|41.25s|and we thank you very much and --
41.25s|44.025s|and we all appreciate that you’re here to do what you --
44.025s|45.987500s|what is a very important civic duty.
46.237500s|48.725s|Now, ladies and gentlemen,
48.725s|50.637500s|this is my opening statement,
50.637500s|53.675s|and the purpose of this statement is so that I can outline to you the evidence
53.687500s|55.175s|that the Crown will be presenting for you
55.187500s|58.35s|so that you can make your proper determination at the end of the case.
58.6s|1m 1.512500s|We will be calling a variety of kinds of evidence.
1m 1.762500s|1m 3.025s|First of all,
1m 3.025s|1m 7.1s|we’re going to start with three police officers who will describe attending to the scene,
1m 7.1s|1m 7.9s|what they saw.
1m 8.15s|1m 11.25s|They will describe the physical setup at the Stanley residence
1m 11.262500s|1m 13.812500s|where this incident occurred. They --
1m 13.812500s|1m 16.1s|you will hear about an examination,
1m 16.1s|1m 17.412500s|a very fine,
1m 17.412500s|1m 19.6s|detailed examination, of --
1m 19.6s|1m 20.625s|of that property.
1m 20.875s|1m 23.462500s|Colten Boushie was in a vehicle when he --
1m 23.462500s|1m 24.537500s|when he was shot.
1m 24.787500s|1m 27.437500s|You will hear that he died of a gunshot wound.
1m 27.687500s|1m 30.7s|There was a careful examination of the vehicle in --
1m 30.7s|1m 32.737500s|at the residence or at the location,
1m 32.737500s|1m 36.9s|plus at the police service bay where they went through this vehicle in very great detail.
1m 37.15s|1m 39.925s|You will also be hearing from a bloodstain pattern analyst
1m 39.937500s|1m 43.375s|who will give you her opinion of what she can determine from the scene,
1m 43.375s|1m 46.25s|and she’ll tell you what she can’t determine from the scene.
1m 46.5s|1m 48.275s|We will then be calling --
1m 48.275s|1m 51.037500s|those are the witnesses that I expect to be calling today.
1m 51.287500s|1m 53.3s|Hopefully we’ll get through them all today.
1m 53.55s|1m 56.375s|Tomorrow we will be calling some civilian evidence.
1m 56.625s|1m 58.1s|And just so you know,
1m 58.1s|1m 59.725s|we have sent subpoenas --
1m 59.725s|2m 1.412500s|we have served subpoenas on everyone
2m 1.425s|2m 3.687500s|who can be compelled to come to court with a subpoena
2m 3.7s|2m 6.437500s|who was there and who has something to say about what happened.
2m 6.687500s|2m 8.05s|And just --
2m 8.05s|2m 9.325s|just so you know,
2m 9.325s|2m 12.912500s|there may well be some serious contradictions between what people saw.
2m 13.162500s|2m 17.075s|You will be in a very good position to determine what you feel the facts are,
2m 17.075s|2m 18.525s|what has been proved to you.
2m 18.775s|2m 22.262500s|His Lordship gave you some preliminary instructions yesterday,
2m 22.262500s|2m 23.662500s|and at the end of the trial,
2m 23.662500s|2m 25.512500s|he will, I am sure,
2m 25.512500s|2m 28.225s|give you further instructions as to how to deal with --
2m 28.225s|2m 31.162500s|with evidence and how you may come to a unanimous conclusion.
2m 31.412500s|2m 33.187500s|Ladies and gentlemen,
2m 33.187500s|2m 36.05s|you will hear that Gerald Stanley resided in the Biggar area.
2m 36.3s|2m 38.662500s|He had a farm there where he raised cattle.
2m 38.912500s|2m 41.362500s|He also did, as I understand,
2m 41.362500s|2m 43.587500s|mechanical work for people in the area.
2m 43.837500s|2m 45.487500s|He would fix vehicles.
2m 45.737500s|2m 47.35s|They would bring them to him,
2m 47.35s|2m 48.85s|leave them in his yard,
2m 48.85s|2m 50.8s|and he would work on those vehicles.
2m 51.05s|2m 55.412500s|The first witness from the civilian side that you will hear from is Sheldon Stanley,
2m 55.412500s|2m 57.3s|and he is Gerald Stanley’s son.
2m 57.55s|3m 0.187500s|He will tell you that he was at his parents’ home --
3m 0.187500s|3m 1.912500s|he doesn’t live there anymore,
3m 1.912500s|3m 6.162500s|but he was at his parents’ home on the 9th of August of 2016,
3m 6.162500s|3m 8.45s|that he and his father were working on a fence.
3m 8.7s|3m 10.412500s|They were building a gate for a fence
3m 10.425s|3m 13.5s|when they heard a rather loud vehicle come into their yard,
3m 13.5s|3m 17.25s|and that he saw this vehicle stop by a truck that had been left to be repaired.
3m 17.5s|3m 20.425s|And someone got out of the vehicle and went into the truck,
3m 20.425s|3m 24.2s|which he just assumed was maybe the owner dropping off a part because that’s --
3m 24.2s|3m 26.662500s|that seemed to be a typical thing that happened when --
3m 26.662500s|3m 29.075s|when Mr. Stanley repaired people’s vehicles.
3m 29.325s|3m 32.562500s|But then this vehicle went further into the -- into the yard,
3m 32.575s|3m 33.825s|towards the shop,
3m 33.825s|3m 35.8s|and someone got out and started --
3m 35.8s|3m 38.625s|tried to start a quad that was in the Stanleys’ yard.
3m 38.875s|3m 40.875s|I believe it was the Stanley --
3m 40.875s|3m 42.4s|belonged to the Stanleys.
3m 42.65s|3m 44.237500s|This caused a reaction.
3m 44.487500s|3m 48.212500s|Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he ran towards where the quad was.
3m 48.462500s|3m 50.1s|His father came with him.
3m 50.35s|3m 53.312500s|There were several people in this car that had entered the yard.
3m 53.562500s|3m 54.662500s|They were --
3m 54.662500s|3m 56.75s|he was yelling at them, that the --
3m 56.75s|3m 58.362500s|the people who were out of the --
3m 58.362500s|4m 0.1s|out of this vehicle got back in.
4m 0.35s|4m 1.737500s|The vehicle backed up.
4m 1.987500s|4m 4.35s|Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he --
4m 4.35s|4m 6.075s|as he was building a fence,
4m 6.075s|4m 7.762500s|he had a tool belt on,
4m 7.762500s|4m 9.225s|and he had his hammer with him.
4m 9.475s|4m 12.312500s|He struck the windshield of this car with a hammer.
4m 12.562500s|4m 16.237500s|The car then headed towards the driveway that would lead to the grid road.
4m 16.487500s|4m 19.237500s|As the car was going in that direction,
4m 19.237500s|4m 21.65s|it collided with another vehicle in their yard.
4m 21.9s|4m 25.95s|Sheldon Stanley says he was running to his house to get his car keys,
4m 25.95s|4m 27.9s|thinking he would be following this vehicle.
4m 28.15s|4m 30.062500s|As he was running into the house,
4m 30.062500s|4m 31.587500s|he heard two gunshots.
4m 31.837500s|4m 34.162500s|When he came out of the house with his --
4m 34.162500s|4m 35.637500s|with his car keys,
4m 35.637500s|4m 37.137500s|he heard another gunshot.
4m 37.387500s|4m 38.15s|He looked.
4m 38.4s|4m 41.45s|He saw his father standing by the driver’s door of this vehicle
4m 41.875s|4m 43.712500s|with a gun and a clip in his hand.
4m 43.962500s|4m 46.737500s|That when Sheldon Stanley approached the vehicle,
4m 46.737500s|4m 49.362500s|he saw Colten Boushie in the driver’s seat,
4m 49.362500s|4m 52.062500s|slumped towards the right with the steering wheel of the vehicle.
4m 52.312500s|4m 54.462500s|There were two females in the back seat.
4m 54.712500s|4m 57.475s|Two other males in the vehicle had got out and ran away
4m 57.487500s|5m 0.075s|after the vehicle collided with the other vehicle.
5m 0.325s|5m 2.037500s|Ladies and gentlemen,
5m 2.037500s|5m 3.125s|this case,
5m 3.125s|5m 5.85s|it might be a shorter case than a lot of murder trials.
5m 6.1s|5m 7.875s|It’s partly because there’s --
5m 7.887500s|5m 9.55s|it’s based on eyewitnesses.
5m 9.8s|5m 12.675s|In addition to that, ladies and gentlemen,
5m 12.675s|5m 14.387500s|my friend has been very --
5m 14.387500s|5m 16.487500s|my friend, Mr. Spencer,
5m 16.487500s|5m 19.25s|has been very professional in his handling of this matter.
5m 19.5s|5m 23.625s|He has agreed to admit many facts that would be easy for the Crown to prove,
5m 23.625s|5m 24.712500s|but it would take --
5m 24.712500s|5m 25.85s|it takes time.
5m 26.1s|5m 27.587500s|It becomes cumbersome.
5m 27.837500s|5m 31.875s|And so we have been able to just get down to what is important in this case.
5m 32.125s|5m 34.325s|And by agreeing to certain facts,
5m 34.325s|5m 36.937500s|we have been able to eliminate a lot of witnesses.
5m 37.187500s|5m 38.6s|That includes --
5m 38.6s|5m 40.812500s|we will be filing reports of experts.
5m 41.062500s|5m 42.925s|There is a report from Mr. --
5m 42.937500s|5m 44.237500s|Dr. Claude Dalpe.
5m 44.487500s|5m 46.562500s|He’s a trace evidence expert,
5m 46.562500s|5m 48.55s|and his report will indicate that --
5m 48.55s|5m 51.037500s|Gerald Stanley was arrested after this incident,
5m 51.05s|5m 52.425s|ladies and gentlemen.
5m 52.675s|5m 55.1s|He was examined by the police for what --
5m 55.1s|5m 57.55s|they use what’s called a gunshot residue kit
5m 57.925s|6m 1.925s|where they check his hands and his face to see if he was in proximity to a firearm.
6m 2.175s|6m 2.95s|And --
6m 2.962500s|6m 5.025s|and there were positive results,
6m 5.025s|6m 8.075s|which means that either Mr. Stanley fired a firearm,
6m 8.075s|6m 11.425s|he was in close proximity to a firearm when it was fired,
6m 11.425s|6m 13.825s|or he handled a firearm that had been fired.
6m 14.075s|6m 18.625s|And that will be in a report from Dr. Dalpe that will be filed as evidence by consent.
6m 18.875s|6m 21.237500s|We have reports from Gillian Sayers.
6m 21.487500s|6m 23.425s|She’s a specialist at the --
6m 23.425s|6m 25.362500s|with the RCMP forensic lab.
6m 25.612500s|6m 29.137500s|So was Dr. Dalpe with the forensic lab of the RCMP.
6m 29.387500s|6m 31.212500s|Gillian Sayers reports --
6m 31.225s|6m 32.087500s|she --
6m 32.087500s|6m 33.925s|she’s a DNA specialist,
6m 33.925s|6m 35.95s|and she has examined certain items,
6m 35.95s|6m 38.862500s|including swabs of blood from the driver’s seat of this vehicle
6m 38.875s|6m 41.937500s|and from the floor of the driver’s compartment of the vehicle,
6m 41.937500s|6m 45.8s|and she’s determined to her satisfaction that this is the blood of Colten Boushie.
6m 46.05s|6m 47.275s|You’ll see her --
6m 47.275s|6m 49.7s|her reports will be in evidence, and --
6m 49.7s|6m 51.587500s|and the number she uses is that --
6m 51.587500s|6m 53.025s|she says it’s his blood,
6m 53.025s|6m 56.687500s|and the chance of this being someone else’s blood is one in a quintillion,
6m 56.687500s|6m 57.462500s|which is --
6m 57.462500s|6m 59.25s|wasn’t a number that I’m familiar with,
6m 59.25s|7m 1.737500s|but it’s a one followed by 18 zeros.
7m 1.987500s|7m 4.975s|So she’s fairly confident as to whose blood this was.
