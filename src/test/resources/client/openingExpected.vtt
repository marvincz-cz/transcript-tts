00:00.050 --> 00:01.312
<v NARRATOR>Opening by Mr. Burge

00:01.675 --> 00:04.212
<v THE COURT CLERK>Mr. Burge, you may need to move the microphone.

00:04.462 --> 00:06.037
<v MR. BURGE>Is it in a proper place?

00:06.312 --> 00:07.387
<v THE COURT CLERK>I can turn you up.

00:07.637 --> 00:08.525
<v MR. BURGE>Thank you.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.625
<v MR. BURGE>Ladies and gentlemen,

00:10.625 --> 00:13.075
<v MR. BURGE>as His Lordship told you yesterday,

00:13.075 --> 00:14.837
<v MR. BURGE>my name is Bill Burge.

00:15.087 --> 00:16.475
<v MR. BURGE>This is Chris Browne.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.162
<v MR. BURGE>We have been assigned to prosecute this matter.

00:19.412 --> 00:20.462
<v MR. BURGE>My friends,

00:20.475 --> 00:22.925
<v MR. BURGE>Scott Spencer and Dustin Gillander [sic],

00:22.925 --> 00:24.750
<v MR. BURGE>are representing Mr. Stanley.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.350
<v MR. BURGE>And, ladies and gentlemen,

00:27.350 --> 00:29.712
<v MR. BURGE>we do thank you for being here today.

00:29.962 --> 00:32.850
<v MR. BURGE>You have an important duty to undertake, and --

00:32.862 --> 00:33.887
<v MR. BURGE>and, of course,

00:33.887 --> 00:37.975
<v MR. BURGE>today presented some trying conditions, I’m sure, for many of you, and --

00:37.987 --> 00:40.237
<v MR. BURGE>and we thank you very much and --

00:40.250 --> 00:43.125
<v MR. BURGE>and we all appreciate that you’re here to do what you --

00:43.137 --> 00:45.187
<v MR. BURGE>what is a very important civic duty.

00:45.437 --> 00:48.037
<v MR. BURGE>Now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:48.037 --> 00:50.000
<v MR. BURGE>this is my opening statement,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.575
<v MR. BURGE>and the purpose of this statement is

00:51.975 --> 00:55.450
<v MR. BURGE>so that I can outline to you the evidence that the Crown will be presenting for you

00:55.887 --> 00:57.962
<v MR. BURGE>so that you can make your proper determination

00:58.250 --> 00:59.425
<v MR. BURGE>at the end of the case.

00:59.675 --> 01:02.587
<v MR. BURGE>We will be calling a variety of kinds of evidence.

01:02.837 --> 01:04.087
<v MR. BURGE>First of all,

01:04.087 --> 01:06.050
<v MR. BURGE>we’re going to start with three police officers

01:06.362 --> 01:08.612
<v MR. BURGE>who will describe attending to the scene,

01:08.612 --> 01:09.475
<v MR. BURGE>what they saw.

01:09.725 --> 01:11.587
<v MR. BURGE>They will describe the physical setup

01:11.962 --> 01:14.587
<v MR. BURGE>at the Stanley residence where this incident occurred.

01:14.837 --> 01:15.937
<v MR. BURGE>They --

01:15.950 --> 01:19.050
<v MR. BURGE>you will hear about an examination, a very fine,

01:19.050 --> 01:21.212
<v MR. BURGE>detailed examination, of --

01:21.225 --> 01:22.300
<v MR. BURGE>of that property.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.412
<v MR. BURGE>Colten Boushie was in a vehicle when he --

01:25.425 --> 01:26.400
<v MR. BURGE>when he was shot.

01:26.650 --> 01:29.237
<v MR. BURGE>You will hear that he died of a gunshot wound.

01:29.487 --> 01:32.550
<v MR. BURGE>There was a careful examination of the vehicle in --

01:32.562 --> 01:34.787
<v MR. BURGE>at the residence or at the location,

01:34.787 --> 01:37.525
<v MR. BURGE>plus at the police service bay where they went through this vehicle

01:37.800 --> 01:39.275
<v MR. BURGE>in very great detail.

01:39.525 --> 01:42.475
<v MR. BURGE>You will also be hearing from a bloodstain pattern analyst

01:42.600 --> 01:45.612
<v MR. BURGE>who will give you her opinion of what she can determine from the scene,

01:45.612 --> 01:48.262
<v MR. BURGE>and she’ll tell you what she can’t determine from the scene.

01:48.512 --> 01:50.512
<v MR. BURGE>We will then be calling --

01:50.525 --> 01:53.512
<v MR. BURGE>those are the witnesses that I expect to be calling today.

01:53.762 --> 01:56.112
<v MR. BURGE>Hopefully we’ll get through them all today.

01:56.362 --> 01:59.200
<v MR. BURGE>Tomorrow we will be calling some civilian evidence.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.075
<v MR. BURGE>And just so you know, we have sent subpoenas --

02:02.087 --> 02:05.462
<v MR. BURGE>we have served subpoenas on everyone who can be compelled to come to court

02:05.800 --> 02:07.512
<v MR. BURGE>with a subpoena who was there

02:07.775 --> 02:09.675
<v MR. BURGE>and who has something to say about what happened.

02:09.925 --> 02:11.200
<v MR. BURGE>And just --

02:11.212 --> 02:12.650
<v MR. BURGE>just so you know,

02:12.650 --> 02:16.350
<v MR. BURGE>there may well be some serious contradictions between what people saw.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.500
<v MR. BURGE>You will be in a very good position to determine what you feel the facts are,

02:20.500 --> 02:21.762
<v MR. BURGE>what has been proved to you.

02:22.012 --> 02:25.400
<v MR. BURGE>His Lordship gave you some preliminary instructions yesterday,

02:25.400 --> 02:28.087
<v MR. BURGE>and at the end of the trial, he will, I am sure,

02:28.087 --> 02:30.775
<v MR. BURGE>give you further instructions as to how to deal with --

02:30.787 --> 02:33.975
<v MR. BURGE>with evidence and how you may come to a unanimous conclusion.

02:34.225 --> 02:36.062
<v MR. BURGE>Ladies and gentlemen,

02:36.062 --> 02:39.287
<v MR. BURGE>you will hear that Gerald Stanley resided in the Biggar area.

02:39.537 --> 02:41.925
<v MR. BURGE>He had a farm there where he raised cattle.

02:42.175 --> 02:46.212
<v MR. BURGE>He also did, as I understand, mechanical work for people in the area.

02:46.462 --> 02:48.000
<v MR. BURGE>He would fix vehicles.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.012
<v MR. BURGE>They would bring them to him,

02:50.012 --> 02:51.525
<v MR. BURGE>leave them in his yard,

02:51.525 --> 02:53.462
<v MR. BURGE>and he would work on those vehicles.

02:53.712 --> 02:58.387
<v MR. BURGE>The first witness from the civilian side that you will hear from is Sheldon Stanley,

02:58.387 --> 03:00.225
<v MR. BURGE>and he is Gerald Stanley’s son.

03:00.475 --> 03:03.337
<v MR. BURGE>He will tell you that he was at his parents’ home --

03:03.350 --> 03:04.800
<v MR. BURGE>he doesn’t live there anymore,

03:04.800 --> 03:08.750
<v MR. BURGE>but he was at his parents’ home on the 9th of August of 2016,

03:08.750 --> 03:11.100
<v MR. BURGE>that he and his father were working on a fence.

03:11.350 --> 03:16.312
<v MR. BURGE>They were building a gate for a fence when they heard a rather loud vehicle come into their yard,

03:16.312 --> 03:18.487
<v MR. BURGE>and that he saw this vehicle stop by a truck

03:18.887 --> 03:20.375
<v MR. BURGE>that had been left to be repaired.

03:20.625 --> 03:23.837
<v MR. BURGE>And someone got out of the vehicle and went into the truck,

03:23.837 --> 03:27.775
<v MR. BURGE>which he just assumed was maybe the owner dropping off a part because that’s --

03:27.787 --> 03:30.637
<v MR. BURGE>that seemed to be a typical thing that happened when --

03:30.650 --> 03:33.262
<v MR. BURGE>when Mr. Stanley repaired people’s vehicles.

03:33.512 --> 03:36.062
<v MR. BURGE>But then this vehicle went further into the --

03:36.075 --> 03:39.987
<v MR. BURGE>into the yard, towards the shop, and someone got out and started --

03:40.000 --> 03:42.725
<v MR. BURGE>tried to start a quad that was in the Stanleys’ yard.

03:42.975 --> 03:45.250
<v MR. BURGE>I believe it was the Stanley --

03:45.262 --> 03:46.912
<v MR. BURGE>belonged to the Stanleys.

03:47.162 --> 03:48.850
<v MR. BURGE>This caused a reaction.

03:49.100 --> 03:53.212
<v MR. BURGE>Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he ran towards where the quad was.

03:53.462 --> 03:54.987
<v MR. BURGE>His father came with him.

03:55.237 --> 03:57.100
<v MR. BURGE>There were several people in this car

03:57.475 --> 03:58.750
<v MR. BURGE>that had entered the yard.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.100
<v MR. BURGE>They were --

04:00.112 --> 04:02.012
<v MR. BURGE>he was yelling at them, that the --

04:02.025 --> 04:03.350
<v MR. BURGE>the people who were out of the --

04:03.362 --> 04:04.962
<v MR. BURGE>out of this vehicle got back in.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.562
<v MR. BURGE>The vehicle backed up.

04:06.812 --> 04:09.450
<v MR. BURGE>Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he --

04:09.462 --> 04:11.062
<v MR. BURGE>as he was building a fence,

04:11.062 --> 04:13.450
<v MR. BURGE>he had a tool belt on, and he had his hammer with him.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.237
<v MR. BURGE>He struck the windshield of this car with a hammer.

04:16.487 --> 04:20.100
<v MR. BURGE>The car then headed towards the driveway that would lead to the grid road.

04:20.350 --> 04:23.000
<v MR. BURGE>As the car was going in that direction,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.350
<v MR. BURGE>it collided with another vehicle in their yard.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.850
<v MR. BURGE>Sheldon Stanley

04:27.200 --> 04:30.250
<v MR. BURGE>says he was running to his house to get his car keys,

04:30.250 --> 04:32.262
<v MR. BURGE>thinking he would be following this vehicle.

04:32.512 --> 04:34.512
<v MR. BURGE>As he was running into the house,

04:34.512 --> 04:36.250
<v MR. BURGE>he heard two gunshots.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.462
<v MR. BURGE>When he came out of the house with his --

04:38.475 --> 04:39.987
<v MR. BURGE>with his car keys,

04:39.987 --> 04:41.650
<v MR. BURGE>he heard another gunshot.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.550
<v MR. BURGE>He looked.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.050
<v MR. BURGE>He saw his father standing by the driver’s door of this vehicle

04:46.500 --> 04:48.762
<v MR. BURGE>with a gun and a clip in his hand.

04:49.012 --> 04:51.800
<v MR. BURGE>That when Sheldon Stanley approached the vehicle,

04:51.800 --> 04:54.550
<v MR. BURGE>he saw Colten Boushie in the driver’s seat,

04:54.550 --> 04:55.625
<v MR. BURGE>slumped towards the right

04:56.000 --> 04:57.862
<v MR. BURGE>with the steering wheel of the vehicle.

04:58.112 --> 05:00.287
<v MR. BURGE>There were two females in the back seat.

05:00.537 --> 05:02.650
<v MR. BURGE>Two other males in the vehicle had got out

05:03.075 --> 05:06.212
<v MR. BURGE>and ran away after the vehicle collided with the other vehicle.

05:06.462 --> 05:08.600
<v MR. BURGE>Ladies and gentlemen, this case,

05:08.600 --> 05:11.450
<v MR. BURGE>it might be a shorter case than a lot of murder trials.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.775
<v MR. BURGE>It’s partly because there’s --

05:13.787 --> 05:15.600
<v MR. BURGE>it’s based on eyewitnesses.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.250
<v MR. BURGE>In addition to that,

05:17.250 --> 05:18.850
<v MR. BURGE>ladies and gentlemen,

05:18.850 --> 05:20.950
<v MR. BURGE>my friend has been very --

05:20.962 --> 05:22.750
<v MR. BURGE>my friend, Mr. Spencer,

05:22.750 --> 05:25.425
<v MR. BURGE>has been very professional in his handling of this matter.

05:25.675 --> 05:29.575
<v MR. BURGE>He has agreed to admit many facts that would be easy for the Crown to prove,

05:29.587 --> 05:30.862
<v MR. BURGE>but it would take --

05:30.875 --> 05:32.125
<v MR. BURGE>it takes time.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.912
<v MR. BURGE>It becomes cumbersome.

05:34.162 --> 05:37.725
<v MR. BURGE>And so we have been able to just get down to what is important in this case.

05:37.975 --> 05:40.462
<v MR. BURGE>And by agreeing to certain facts,

05:40.462 --> 05:43.050
<v MR. BURGE>we have been able to eliminate a lot of witnesses.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.825
<v MR. BURGE>That includes --

05:44.837 --> 05:47.225
<v MR. BURGE>we will be filing reports of experts.

05:47.475 --> 05:49.662
<v MR. BURGE>There is a report from Mr. --

05:49.675 --> 05:50.950
<v MR. BURGE>Dr. Claude Dalpe.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.237
<v MR. BURGE>He’s a trace evidence expert,

05:53.237 --> 05:55.600
<v MR. BURGE>and his report will indicate that --

05:55.612 --> 05:59.275
<v MR. BURGE>Gerald Stanley was arrested after this incident, ladies and gentlemen.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.050
<v MR. BURGE>He was examined by the police for what --

06:02.062 --> 06:05.762
<v MR. BURGE>they use what’s called a gunshot residue kit where they check his hands and his face

06:06.150 --> 06:08.650
<v MR. BURGE>to see if he was in proximity to a firearm.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.100
<v MR. BURGE>And --

06:10.112 --> 06:12.050
<v MR. BURGE>and there were positive results,

06:12.050 --> 06:15.337
<v MR. BURGE>which means that either Mr. Stanley fired a firearm,

06:15.337 --> 06:18.650
<v MR. BURGE>he was in close proximity to a firearm when it was fired,

06:18.650 --> 06:21.000
<v MR. BURGE>or he handled a firearm that had been fired.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.487
<v MR. BURGE>And that will be in a report from Dr. Dalpe that will be filed as

06:24.575 --> 06:25.887
<v MR. BURGE>evidence by consent.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.562
<v MR. BURGE>We have reports from Gillian Sayers.

06:28.812 --> 06:30.600
<v MR. BURGE>She’s a specialist at the --

06:30.612 --> 06:32.725
<v MR. BURGE>with the RCMP forensic lab.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.525
<v MR. BURGE>So was Dr. Dalpe with the forensic lab of the RCMP.

06:36.775 --> 06:38.975
<v MR. BURGE>Gillian Sayers reports --

06:38.987 --> 06:40.050
<v MR. BURGE>she --

06:40.062 --> 06:43.650
<v MR. BURGE>she’s a DNA specialist, and she has examined certain items,

06:43.650 --> 06:46.762
<v MR. BURGE>including swabs of blood from the driver’s seat of this vehicle

06:47.187 --> 06:50.050
<v MR. BURGE>and from the floor of the driver’s compartment of the vehicle,

06:50.050 --> 06:53.975
<v MR. BURGE>and she’s determined to her satisfaction that this is the blood of Colten Boushie.

06:54.225 --> 06:55.600
<v MR. BURGE>You’ll see her --

06:55.612 --> 06:58.000
<v MR. BURGE>her reports will be in evidence, and --

06:58.012 --> 07:00.075
<v MR. BURGE>and the number she uses is that --

07:00.087 --> 07:01.262
<v MR. BURGE>she says it’s his blood,

07:01.262 --> 07:04.225
<v MR. BURGE>and the chance of this being someone else’s blood is one in a quintillion,

07:04.237 --> 07:05.150
<v MR. BURGE>which is --

07:05.162 --> 07:09.375
<v MR. BURGE>wasn’t a number that I’m familiar with, but it’s a one followed by 18 zeros.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.800
<v MR. BURGE>So she’s fairly confident as to whose blood this was.
