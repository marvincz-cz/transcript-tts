<v NARRATOR>Opening by Mr. Burge

00:00:01.812 --> 00:00:04.412
<v THE COURT CLERK>Mr. Burge, you may need to move the microphone.

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:06.362
<v MR. BURGE>Is it in a proper place?

00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:07.687
<v THE COURT CLERK>I can turn you up.

00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:08.850
<v MR. BURGE>Thank you.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.775
<v MR. BURGE>Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:13.050
<v MR. BURGE>as His Lordship told you yesterday,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.687
<v MR. BURGE>my name is Bill Burge.

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:16.362
<v MR. BURGE>This is Chris Browne.

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:19.450
<v MR. BURGE>We have been assigned to prosecute this matter.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.787
<v MR. BURGE>My friends,

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.212
<v MR. BURGE>Scott Spencer and Dustin Gillander [sic],

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:25.050
<v MR. BURGE>are representing Mr. Stanley.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.712
<v MR. BURGE>And, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:29.737
<v MR. BURGE>we do thank you for being here today.

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:32.225
<v MR. BURGE>You have an important duty to undertake,

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:34.425
<v MR. BURGE>and -- and, of course,

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.625
<v MR. BURGE>today presented some trying conditions,

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.362
<v MR. BURGE>I’m sure, for many of you, and --

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:41.250
<v MR. BURGE>and we thank you very much and --

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.025
<v MR. BURGE>and we all appreciate that you’re here to do what you --

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:45.987
<v MR. BURGE>what is a very important civic duty.

00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:48.725
<v MR. BURGE>Now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.637
<v MR. BURGE>this is my opening statement,

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:53.675
<v MR. BURGE>and the purpose of this statement is so that I can outline to you the evidence

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.175
<v MR. BURGE>that the Crown will be presenting for you

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:58.350
<v MR. BURGE>so that you can make your proper determination at the end of the case.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.512
<v MR. BURGE>We will be calling a variety of kinds of evidence.

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.025
<v MR. BURGE>First of all,

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:07.100
<v MR. BURGE>we’re going to start with three police officers who will describe attending to the scene,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.900
<v MR. BURGE>what they saw.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.250
<v MR. BURGE>They will describe the physical setup at the Stanley residence

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:13.812
<v MR. BURGE>where this incident occurred. They --

00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:16.100
<v MR. BURGE>you will hear about an examination,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.412
<v MR. BURGE>a very fine,

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:19.600
<v MR. BURGE>detailed examination, of --

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.625
<v MR. BURGE>of that property.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.462
<v MR. BURGE>Colten Boushie was in a vehicle when he --

00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:24.537
<v MR. BURGE>when he was shot.

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:27.437
<v MR. BURGE>You will hear that he died of a gunshot wound.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.700
<v MR. BURGE>There was a careful examination of the vehicle in --

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.737
<v MR. BURGE>at the residence or at the location,

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:36.900
<v MR. BURGE>plus at the police service bay where they went through this vehicle in very great detail.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.925
<v MR. BURGE>You will also be hearing from a bloodstain pattern analyst

00:01:39.937 --> 00:01:43.375
<v MR. BURGE>who will give you her opinion of what she can determine from the scene,

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:46.250
<v MR. BURGE>and she’ll tell you what she can’t determine from the scene.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.275
<v MR. BURGE>We will then be calling --

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.037
<v MR. BURGE>those are the witnesses that I expect to be calling today.

00:01:51.287 --> 00:01:53.300
<v MR. BURGE>Hopefully we’ll get through them all today.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.375
<v MR. BURGE>Tomorrow we will be calling some civilian evidence.

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.100
<v MR. BURGE>And just so you know,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.725
<v MR. BURGE>we have sent subpoenas --

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:01.412
<v MR. BURGE>we have served subpoenas on everyone

00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:03.687
<v MR. BURGE>who can be compelled to come to court with a subpoena

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.437
<v MR. BURGE>who was there and who has something to say about what happened.

00:02:06.687 --> 00:02:08.050
<v MR. BURGE>And just --

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.325
<v MR. BURGE>just so you know,

00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:12.912
<v MR. BURGE>there may well be some serious contradictions between what people saw.

00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:17.075
<v MR. BURGE>You will be in a very good position to determine what you feel the facts are,

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.525
<v MR. BURGE>what has been proved to you.

00:02:18.775 --> 00:02:22.262
<v MR. BURGE>His Lordship gave you some preliminary instructions yesterday,

00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:23.662
<v MR. BURGE>and at the end of the trial,

00:02:23.662 --> 00:02:25.512
<v MR. BURGE>he will, I am sure,

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.225
<v MR. BURGE>give you further instructions as to how to deal with --

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.162
<v MR. BURGE>with evidence and how you may come to a unanimous conclusion.

00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:33.187
<v MR. BURGE>Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:36.050
<v MR. BURGE>you will hear that Gerald Stanley resided in the Biggar area.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.662
<v MR. BURGE>He had a farm there where he raised cattle.

00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:41.362
<v MR. BURGE>He also did, as I understand,

00:02:41.362 --> 00:02:43.587
<v MR. BURGE>mechanical work for people in the area.

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:45.487
<v MR. BURGE>He would fix vehicles.

00:02:45.737 --> 00:02:47.350
<v MR. BURGE>They would bring them to him,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.850
<v MR. BURGE>leave them in his yard,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.800
<v MR. BURGE>and he would work on those vehicles.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.412
<v MR. BURGE>The first witness from the civilian side that you will hear from is Sheldon Stanley,

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:57.300
<v MR. BURGE>and he is Gerald Stanley’s son.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.187
<v MR. BURGE>He will tell you that he was at his parents’ home --

00:03:00.187 --> 00:03:01.912
<v MR. BURGE>he doesn’t live there anymore,

00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:06.162
<v MR. BURGE>but he was at his parents’ home on the 9th of August of 2016,

00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:08.450
<v MR. BURGE>that he and his father were working on a fence.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.412
<v MR. BURGE>They were building a gate for a fence

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:13.500
<v MR. BURGE>when they heard a rather loud vehicle come into their yard,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.250
<v MR. BURGE>and that he saw this vehicle stop by a truck that had been left to be repaired.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.425
<v MR. BURGE>And someone got out of the vehicle and went into the truck,

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:24.200
<v MR. BURGE>which he just assumed was maybe the owner dropping off a part because that’s --

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.662
<v MR. BURGE>that seemed to be a typical thing that happened when --

00:03:26.662 --> 00:03:29.075
<v MR. BURGE>when Mr. Stanley repaired people’s vehicles.

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:32.562
<v MR. BURGE>But then this vehicle went further into the -- into the yard,

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:33.825
<v MR. BURGE>towards the shop,

00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:35.800
<v MR. BURGE>and someone got out and started --

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.625
<v MR. BURGE>tried to start a quad that was in the Stanleys’ yard.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.875
<v MR. BURGE>I believe it was the Stanley --

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.400
<v MR. BURGE>belonged to the Stanleys.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.237
<v MR. BURGE>This caused a reaction.

00:03:44.487 --> 00:03:48.212
<v MR. BURGE>Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he ran towards where the quad was.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:50.100
<v MR. BURGE>His father came with him.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.312
<v MR. BURGE>There were several people in this car that had entered the yard.

00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:54.662
<v MR. BURGE>They were --

00:03:54.662 --> 00:03:56.750
<v MR. BURGE>he was yelling at them, that the --

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.362
<v MR. BURGE>the people who were out of the --

00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.100
<v MR. BURGE>out of this vehicle got back in.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.737
<v MR. BURGE>The vehicle backed up.

00:04:01.987 --> 00:04:04.350
<v MR. BURGE>Sheldon Stanley will tell you that he --

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.075
<v MR. BURGE>as he was building a fence,

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:07.762
<v MR. BURGE>he had a tool belt on,

00:04:07.762 --> 00:04:09.225
<v MR. BURGE>and he had his hammer with him.

00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:12.312
<v MR. BURGE>He struck the windshield of this car with a hammer.

00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:16.237
<v MR. BURGE>The car then headed towards the driveway that would lead to the grid road.

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:19.237
<v MR. BURGE>As the car was going in that direction,

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:21.650
<v MR. BURGE>it collided with another vehicle in their yard.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.950
<v MR. BURGE>Sheldon Stanley says he was running to his house to get his car keys,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.900
<v MR. BURGE>thinking he would be following this vehicle.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.062
<v MR. BURGE>As he was running into the house,

00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:31.587
<v MR. BURGE>he heard two gunshots.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:34.162
<v MR. BURGE>When he came out of the house with his --

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:35.637
<v MR. BURGE>with his car keys,

00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:37.137
<v MR. BURGE>he heard another gunshot.

00:04:37.387 --> 00:04:38.150
<v MR. BURGE>He looked.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.450
<v MR. BURGE>He saw his father standing by the driver’s door of this vehicle

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:43.712
<v MR. BURGE>with a gun and a clip in his hand.

00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:46.737
<v MR. BURGE>That when Sheldon Stanley approached the vehicle,

00:04:46.737 --> 00:04:49.362
<v MR. BURGE>he saw Colten Boushie in the driver’s seat,

00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:52.062
<v MR. BURGE>slumped towards the right with the steering wheel of the vehicle.

00:04:52.312 --> 00:04:54.462
<v MR. BURGE>There were two females in the back seat.

00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:57.475
<v MR. BURGE>Two other males in the vehicle had got out and ran away

00:04:57.487 --> 00:05:00.075
<v MR. BURGE>after the vehicle collided with the other vehicle.

00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:02.037
<v MR. BURGE>Ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:03.125
<v MR. BURGE>this case,

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.850
<v MR. BURGE>it might be a shorter case than a lot of murder trials.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.875
<v MR. BURGE>It’s partly because there’s --

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:09.550
<v MR. BURGE>it’s based on eyewitnesses.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.675
<v MR. BURGE>In addition to that, ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:14.387
<v MR. BURGE>my friend has been very --

00:05:14.387 --> 00:05:16.487
<v MR. BURGE>my friend, Mr. Spencer,

00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:19.250
<v MR. BURGE>has been very professional in his handling of this matter.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.625
<v MR. BURGE>He has agreed to admit many facts that would be easy for the Crown to prove,

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:24.712
<v MR. BURGE>but it would take --

00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:25.850
<v MR. BURGE>it takes time.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.587
<v MR. BURGE>It becomes cumbersome.

00:05:27.837 --> 00:05:31.875
<v MR. BURGE>And so we have been able to just get down to what is important in this case.

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.325
<v MR. BURGE>And by agreeing to certain facts,

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:36.937
<v MR. BURGE>we have been able to eliminate a lot of witnesses.

00:05:37.187 --> 00:05:38.600
<v MR. BURGE>That includes --

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.812
<v MR. BURGE>we will be filing reports of experts.

00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:42.925
<v MR. BURGE>There is a report from Mr. --

00:05:42.937 --> 00:05:44.237
<v MR. BURGE>Dr. Claude Dalpe.

00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:46.562
<v MR. BURGE>He’s a trace evidence expert,

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:48.550
<v MR. BURGE>and his report will indicate that --

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.037
<v MR. BURGE>Gerald Stanley was arrested after this incident,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.425
<v MR. BURGE>ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:55.100
<v MR. BURGE>He was examined by the police for what --

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.550
<v MR. BURGE>they use what’s called a gunshot residue kit

00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:01.925
<v MR. BURGE>where they check his hands and his face to see if he was in proximity to a firearm.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:02.950
<v MR. BURGE>And --

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.025
<v MR. BURGE>and there were positive results,

00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:08.075
<v MR. BURGE>which means that either Mr. Stanley fired a firearm,

00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:11.425
<v MR. BURGE>he was in close proximity to a firearm when it was fired,

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:13.825
<v MR. BURGE>or he handled a firearm that had been fired.

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:18.625
<v MR. BURGE>And that will be in a report from Dr. Dalpe that will be filed as evidence by consent.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:21.237
<v MR. BURGE>We have reports from Gillian Sayers.

00:06:21.487 --> 00:06:23.425
<v MR. BURGE>She’s a specialist at the --

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.362
<v MR. BURGE>with the RCMP forensic lab.

00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:29.137
<v MR. BURGE>So was Dr. Dalpe with the forensic lab of the RCMP.

00:06:29.387 --> 00:06:31.212
<v MR. BURGE>Gillian Sayers reports --

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.087
<v MR. BURGE>she --

00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:33.925
<v MR. BURGE>she’s a DNA specialist,

00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:35.950
<v MR. BURGE>and she has examined certain items,

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.862
<v MR. BURGE>including swabs of blood from the driver’s seat of this vehicle

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:41.937
<v MR. BURGE>and from the floor of the driver’s compartment of the vehicle,

00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:45.800
<v MR. BURGE>and she’s determined to her satisfaction that this is the blood of Colten Boushie.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.275
<v MR. BURGE>You’ll see her --

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.700
<v MR. BURGE>her reports will be in evidence, and --

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.587
<v MR. BURGE>and the number she uses is that --

00:06:51.587 --> 00:06:53.025
<v MR. BURGE>she says it’s his blood,

00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:56.687
<v MR. BURGE>and the chance of this being someone else’s blood is one in a quintillion,

00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:57.462
<v MR. BURGE>which is --

00:06:57.462 --> 00:06:59.250
<v MR. BURGE>wasn’t a number that I’m familiar with,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.737
<v MR. BURGE>but it’s a one followed by 18 zeros.

00:07:01.987 --> 00:07:04.975
<v MR. BURGE>So she’s fairly confident as to whose blood this was.
